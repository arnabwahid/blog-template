<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I wrote posts like this a long time ago, and I have come to regret writing them. Posts like this do not age well, and are unnecessarily antagonistic. Nonetheless, I keep these blog posts around as a reminder for myself to be more tolerant and even-tempered. Hopefully you may find some humor in them.</em></p>
